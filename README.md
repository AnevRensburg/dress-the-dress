# Dress the Dress

This website was created for Dress-the-Dress, a business specializing in rhinestone distribution. Unfortunately, the business is no longer operational, so the website is no longer in use.

I have designed and implemented this website using HTML and CSS with Bootstrap. My approach avoids the use of website generators like WordPress and CMS platforms, allowing me to apply and enhance my skills effectively. This site is reactive and presents well on all mobile devices as well as full-sized computer screens.
